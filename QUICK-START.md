You need to create these folders in your GitHub repo and add images:

**Create folder structure:**

3. Upload your white logo image
4. Repeat for these folders:
   - `images/gallery/` (your portfolio photos)
   - `images/night-sky/` (night sky images)
   - `images/usa-2025/` (USA trip photos)
   - `images/panoramas/` (360 panoramas)

**What images you need:**
- logo.png (your watermark - get from Wix site)
- hero1.jpg, hero2.jpg, hero3.jpg (3 photos for homepage)
- profile.jpg (your photo for About page)
- features.png (the featured publications banner from Wix)
- All your gallery photos

## Step 3: Update Image Names (5 minutes)

After uploading images, edit these files to match your actual filenames:

1. Click on `index.html` in GitHub
2. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
3. Find lines 43-51 (the image grid)
4. Change `hero1.jpg`, `hero2.jpg`, `hero3.jpg` to match your actual filenames
5. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
